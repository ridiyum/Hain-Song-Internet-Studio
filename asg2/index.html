    <h1>Assignment 2</h1>
  
      <h2>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h2>
      <p>Structured content means organizing information into meaningful parts so that 
          it can be reused and understood by both people and machines. Semantic HTML means 
          using HTML tags that describe the meaning
          of content instead of just controlling its appearance.
      </p>
 
      <h2>How do they work together?</h2>
      <p>Structured content defines what the pieces of information are and how they relate.
          Semantic HTML provides the standard markup to express those pieces on a webpage.
          Together, they make content clear for humans, search engines, and smart assistants.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Why is it important to have both?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Improves accessibility for screen readers and assistive technologies.</li>
        <li>Makes content machine-readable for search engines and voice assistants.</li>
        <li>Ensures consistency and reusability across different platforms.</li>
        <li>Helps future-proof your content for new devices and interfaces.</li>
      </ul>
