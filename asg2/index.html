    <h1>Assignment 2</h1>
  
      <h2>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h2>
      <p>Structured content means organizing information into meaningful parts so that 
          it can be reused and understood by both people and machines. Semantic HTML means 
          using HTML tags that describe the meaning
          of content instead of just controlling its appearance.
      </p>
 
      <h2>How do they work together?</h2>
      <p>Structured content defines what the pieces of information are and how they relate.
          Semantic HTML provides the standard markup to express those pieces on a webpage.
          Together, they make content clear for humans, search engines, and smart assistants.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Why is it important to have both?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Improves accessibility for screen readers and assistive technologies.</li>
        <li>Makes content machine-readable for search engines and voice assistants.</li>
        <li>Ensures consistency and reusability across different platforms.</li>
        <li>Helps future-proof your content for new devices and interfaces.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Banishing Your Inner Critic (Denise Jacobs)</h3>
    <p>
      Jacobs describes the inner critic as a troll that blocks creativity. The method that would 
      be most successful for me is reframing negative thoughts into positive ones. This helps 
      me overcome overthinking and stay productive during creative work.
    </p>

    <h3>Procrastination (David McRaney)</h3>
    <p>
      Hyperbolic discounting is the tendency to prefer smaller, immediate rewards over larger, 
      delayed rewards. One method to counteract this is to break big tasks into smaller, 
      manageable steps with immediate deadlines. This would work best for me because I am 
      motivated by completing smaller tasks and seeing progress quickly.

    <h3>Critical Web Design: Chapter 1</h3>
    <p>
      Critical Web Design identifies four types of power in networks: network-making, gatekeeping, 
      protocol, and programming power. As a creator and publisher of my work, I have network-making 
      power because I can design and share content that connects with users. I do not have protocol 
      power, as I cannot define technical standards for the web.
