	<h2>Question 2</h2>
	<p>Stories create clarity because you define the user, problem, solution, and outcome.
		This exposes gaps in logic and questionable assumptions. 
		Stories also show the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what". 
		You communicate the rationale behind design decisions through human-centered scenarios. This approach makes your proposals more compelling 
		and easier to understand, as people can see not just what you're building, but why it matters to real users.
		You can also become capable of empathizing with users through stories for a better understanding of the emotional side of the experience.
