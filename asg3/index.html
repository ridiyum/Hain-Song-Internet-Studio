	<h1>Assignment 3</h1>
	<p>Reading Questions</p>
	<h2>Question One</h2>
	<p>This website doesn't keep their clickable elements consistent, which can be misleading when searching for where to click. 
		Sometimes it can be the photos or the underlined text. This website sparked controversy in the past before because of it's UI consistency problems. 
		Below is an example for a violation of number 6
	</p>

	<h2>Question 2</h2>
	<p>Stories create clarity because you define the user, problem, solution, and outcome.
		This exposes gaps in logic and questionable assumptions. 
		Stories also show the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what". 
		You communicate the rationale behind design decisions through human-centered scenarios. This approach makes your proposals more compelling 
		and easier to understand, as people can see not just what you're building, but why it matters to real users.
		You can also become capable of empathizing with users through stories for a better understanding of the emotional side of the experience.

	<h2>Question 3</h2>
	<p>Hierarchy can be established by size, weight, color, style and placement. Below is an example.</p>

		<td>What problem are we solving? How?<br>
			Students in Fort Worth waste valuable study time searching for appropriate study locations. 
			Study Haven solves this by creating a centralized database of student-focused study spaces with detailed filtering options.
			<br><br>

			Why are we solving this problem? What's the benefit?<br>
			This improves student productivity and academic success by eliminating the frustration of location hunting. 
			Students can focus their energy on actual studying rather than logistics.<br><br>

			How does this problem align with our product/service?<br>
			Study Haven directly addresses the gap in location discovery tools by providing student specific criteria like Wi-Fi quality, 
			noise levels, and real-time crowding updates that generic apps don't offer.

	<tr>
		<td>What are the deliverables for this project?<br>
			Fully functional website with location database, user review system, real-time updates feature, mobile-responsive design, 
			and initial database of 25+ Fort Worth study locations.<br><br>

			Do we anticipate any internal/external factors compromising the completion of the above deliverables? If so, how? Why?<br>
			Potential challenges include gathering initial location data, encouraging early user adoption for reviews, and maintaining real-time update accuracy. 
			Mitigation involves partnering with student organizations and creating incentives for user contributions.<br><br>
