            <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Sketching Wireframes</h3>
            <p>According to the UXPin guide, sketching wireframes offers significant advantages in <strong>speed and flexibility</strong>, allowing designers to quickly pull out paper and draw ideas as they come without the interruption of searching through digital element libraries or memorizing shortcuts. This method also provides <strong>limited distractions</strong>, helping the team focus purely on the product's structure, content, and functionality rather than on visual design details like fonts and colors. However, sketching has several disadvantages, including <strong>duplicate work</strong>, as sketches must be recreated in another tool for further development, and <strong>low-fidelity</strong>, making it difficult to include media, fonts, or show interactions. It also lacks <strong>collaboration features and version control</strong>, and sketches can be inconsistent or "ugly" if the creator lacks drawing skill, potentially rendering them useless for communication.</p>
            
            <h3>Recommended Wireframing Style for Study Haven</h3>
            <p>For my <strong>Study Haven</strong> project, which is in its early conceptual stages, a hybrid approach starting with <strong>sketching</strong> and then moving to <strong>digital wireframing software</strong> would be most effective. The initial sketching phase is ideal for rapidly brainstorming the core layout, user flows, and information hierarchy of the virtual study spaces without getting bogged down by technical details. This aligns perfectly with the guide's principle to "experiment & collaborate quickly." Once the core concepts are validated, transitioning to a tool like <strong>UXPin</strong> would be beneficial. This would allow us to build on the initial sketches, create a <strong>click-through prototype</strong> to test key interactions like joining a study room, and leverage <strong>element libraries</strong> for consistency. This digital step is crucial for collaborating effectively with potential users and developers, ensuring the final design for Study Haven is both user-centered and feasible to build.</p>
