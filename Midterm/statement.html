			<h2>My Visual & Interaction Design Choices</h2>
			
			<p>For my Bahamas destination website, I chose a color palette inspired by the Bahamian flag and natural environment because these colors represent why I want to visit this beautiful location. The primary colors are aqua blue (#00A0B0), golden yellow (#FFC72C), and black (#000000), which represent the ocean, sun, and strength of the Bahamian people. These colors immediately evoke the tropical feeling of the islands that attracts me to this destination while maintaining good readability and visual hierarchy.</p>
			
			<p>I selected Abel as my font because I appreciate its clean, modern appearance that feels both professional and approachable. Using Abel in both regular and bold weights allows me to create clear visual hierarchy without complicating the design. The bold weight (700) works well for headings and navigation to draw attention, while the regular weight (400) provides comfortable readability for longer text sections about why I want to visit the Bahamas and what I hope to experience there.</p>
			
			<p>The navigation menu uses a simple, centered layout that I find intuitive as a beginner web developer. I included CTA buttons on the homepage because they're required for the assignment, but I've personalized the text to reflect that this is about my dream vacation rather than a commercial tourism site. I chose vibrant, high-quality images that showcase exactly what draws me to the Bahamas - the crystal clear waters, unique experiences like swimming with pigs, and the beautiful beach landscapes. The overall design reflects my personal excitement about visiting this destination while meeting all the assignment requirements.</p>
