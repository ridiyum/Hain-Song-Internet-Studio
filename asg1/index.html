    <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
    <p>The web is in constant flux, so developers and designers must stay adaptable as tools, standards, and expectations evolve.</p>
    <p>Building on web standards ensures long-term stability and accessibility, unlike many frameworks and hacks that may become outdated.</p>
    <p>Creativity, experimentation, and sharing are fundamental to the spirit of the web and fuel its continuous innovation.</p>


    <h2>Semester Project: Local Study Spot Finder</h2> 
    <p>For my semester project, I would like to create a website called "Study Haven" that helps students in Fort Worth find the perfect study locations based on their specific needs. The site would feature a database of local coffee shops, libraries, quiet restaurants, and other study-friendly venues, complete with detailed information about each location, including Wi-Fi quality, noise levels, outlet availability, operating hours, and whether food/drinks are allowed. Users could filter locations by criteria like "24-hour access," "group study friendly," or "complete silence required." Each location would have user-submitted photos, reviews, and real-time updates about crowding levels. This website addresses a real problem that many students face: spending valuable study time searching for the right environment instead of actually studying. By creating a centralized resource with reliable, student-focused information, Study Haven would help fellow students be more productive and make better use of their study time.</p>
