                <p>I explained the Six Hats method to my partner, a fellow student who understands the constraints of a class project. Wearing the Blue Hat, I set the goal: to critically evaluate the "Study Haven" concept as a manageable, one-person website built within a single semester. We agreed to focus on what is feasible for a solo developer with limited time and budget, and to prioritize the core features that deliver the most value without being overly complex.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Under the White Hat, we looked at the facts. The core idea is a static website with a database of study spots. The key facts are that I, as a single developer, have the skills to build this using basic web development tools (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and can host it for free on a platform like GitHub Pages or Netlify. The major information gap is how to populate the database. We concluded that manually researching and entering 20-30 locations around my own campus is the only realistic path. The "real-time crowding" and "user-submitted photos/reviews" are not feasible for this scope, as they require complex back-end systems, user authentication, and constant moderation.</p>

                </div>
                <p>With the Red Hat on, my partner shared their gut feelings. They loved the core idea, saying, "This is such a useful tool, and it feels totally achievable." They were excited by the potential to actually use it themselves next semester. However, they expressed a immediate worry about the project becoming a "time sink," especially if I tried to build too many features. My own feeling was enthusiasm for solving a real problem, but also nervousness about the data entry being tedious and the site looking too simple or static.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Thinking with the Yellow Hat, we focused on why a simplified version would work brilliantly. The primary value isn't in real-time data; it's in the curated filters. A simple, fast-loading site that reliably tells a student where to find a quiet coffee shop with good Wi-Fi and outlets is incredibly valuable. We agreed that even a static list, beautifully organized and easy to search, would be a huge success for a class project and genuinely helpful for users. Its success would be measured by its usability and clarity, not by complex community features.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Putting on the Black Hat, we identified the biggest risks for a solo developer. The main pitfall is scope creepâ€”trying to build the "perfect" version with user accounts and live updates, which would guarantee the project wouldn't get finished. Secondly, manually maintained data can become outdated quickly (e.g., a coffee shop closes or changes its Wi-Fi password), which could frustrate users. Finally, without a backend, any "filtering" would have to be done client-side, which might be slow if the list of locations gets very long.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The Green Hat session was about finding clever, simple solutions. To avoid scope creep, we decided the site should be a curated guide, not a dynamic platform. Instead of user reviews, I could include a brief, static "Pro-Tip" for each location that I write myself. To handle filtering without a complex database, I can use a simple JavaScript library to filter HTML elements on the page. To address data staleness, I can add a clear disclaimer: "This is a student project. Information was verified on [Date]. Please call ahead to confirm." This manages user expectations realistically.</p>

                    <p>This conversation was a crucial reality check that has dramatically simplified and improved my project plan. I am completely re-scoping "Study Haven" from a dynamic platform to a statically generated, curated guide. I will remove all specifications for user accounts, real-time updates, and crowd-sourced reviews. The new core functionality is a single page with a list of 20-30 hand-picked locations around my campus. I will implement simple client-side filtering (for noise level, outlets, etc.) using JavaScript. Each location will have the essential details I can reliably research (Wi-Fi, hours, outlet availability), along with a photo I take myself and a short, written "Pro-Tip." By embracing these limitations, I can create a polished, useful, and fully functional website within the semester that demonstrates core web development skills and solves the original problem in a practical, achievable way.</p>
