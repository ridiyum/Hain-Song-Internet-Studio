                <p>I explained the Six Hats method to my partner, a fellow student who understands the constraints of a class project. Wearing the Blue Hat, I set the goal: to critically evaluate the "Study Haven" concept as a manageable, one-person website built within a single semester. We agreed to focus on what is feasible for a solo developer with limited time and budget, and to prioritize the core features that deliver the most value without being overly complex.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Under the White Hat, we looked at the facts. The core idea is a static website with a database of study spots. The key facts are that I, as a single developer, have the skills to build this using basic web development tools (HTML, CSS) and can host it for free on a platform like GitHub Pages or Netlify. The major information gap is how to populate the database. We concluded that manually researching and entering 10-30 locations around my own campus is the only realistic path. The "real-time crowding" and "user-submitted photos/reviews" are not feasible for this scope, as they require complex back-end systems, user authentication, and constant moderation.</p>

                </div>
                <p>With the Red Hat on, my partner shared their gut feelings. They loved the core idea, saying, "This is such a useful tool, and it feels totally achievable." They were excited by the potential to actually use it themselves next semester. However, they expressed a immediate worry about the project becoming a "time sink," especially if I tried to build too many features. My own feeling was enthusiasm for solving a real problem, but also nervousness about the data entry being tedious and the site looking too simple or static.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Thinking with the Yellow Hat, we focused on why a simplified version would work brilliantly. The primary value isn't in real-time data; it's in the curated filters. A simple, fast-loading site that reliably tells a student where to find a quiet coffee shop with good Wi-Fi and outlets is incredibly valuable. We agreed that even a static list, beautifully organized and easy to search, would be a huge success for a class project and genuinely helpful for users. Its success would be measured by its usability and clarity, not by complex community features.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Putting on the Black Hat, we identified the biggest risks for a solo developer. The main pitfall is creating an unrealistic scope trying to build the "perfect" version with user accounts and live updates, which would guarantee the project wouldn't get finished. Secondly, manually maintained data can become outdated quickly (e.g., a coffee shop closes or changes its Wi-Fi password), which could frustrate users. Finally, without a backend, any "filtering" would have to be done client-side, which might be slow if the list of locations gets very long.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The Green Hat session was about finding clever, simple solutions to the Black Hat problems. To solve the initial data gap without a formal ambassador program, we thought I could personally visit and review the top 10-15 most popular spots near campus to create a solid core of reliable entries. To address sustainability and user engagement without a backend or complex features, we brainstormed using a simple, external tool like a dedicated Google Form linked from the site, allowing users to suggest new locations or report outdated information, which I could then manually review and add. This keeps the site static and manageable for a solo developer but still incorporates a pathway for community feedback and growth. We also thought a "Featured Spot of the Week" on the homepage would be a simple, manual way to keep the content feeling fresh and dynamic</p>

                    <p>This conversation fundamentally reshaped my project from an ambitious web platform to a practical, achievable student resource. I've abandoned all complex features like real-time data, user reviews, and dynamic filtering. The new "Study Haven" will be a clean, static website built with HTML and CSS, functioning as a curated guide rather than a dynamic app. The core will be a hand-picked directory of 15-20 locations I've personally verified, organized into simple categories like "Quiet Libraries" and "Group-Friendly Cafes." To solve the data problem, I'll include a link to a Google Form for community suggestions, which I can manually process. This streamlined approach allows me to deliver a fully functional, useful, and polished product within the semester constraints, perfectly solving the original problem of helping students find study spots without getting bogged down in unmanageable technical complexity.</p>
